# aug_validateform_generator

The powerful code generation engine behind `aug_validateform`.

This package is a developer-tooling companion for the `aug_validateform` system. I utilize `build_runner` and `source_gen` to parse validation annotations and produce high-performance, reactive validation mixins.

---

## Purpose

`aug_validateform_generator` automates the complex logic required to handle multiple validation rules, cross-field matching, and real-time state updates. By offloading this to a generator, your source code remains clean and focused on business logic.

---

## Getting Started

Add this as a `dev_dependency` in your Flutter project:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  aug_validateform_generator: latest_version
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

For full implementation and usage instructions, please refer to the primary [aug_validateform](https://pub.dev/packages/aug_validateform) documentation.
